        <h3>Welcome!</h3>
        <p>This application is part of PM Home Station project.</p>
        <p>You need hardware particular matter monitor to check
        your air quality.</p>
        <p>You may buy it from someone or assemble by yourself.</p>
        <p>Please visit <a href="https://github.com/rjaros87/pm-home-station/">Project Page</a> for information which parts are necessary and how to assemble them. You will need <i>Bluetooth Low Energy</i> version.</p>

        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Since we live in big polluted cities the air quality is on a very poor level. But, the problem is not only connected to the big cities - even smaller cities and villages may suffer from air pollution. That's why we've created this little project to let you build your own Particulate Matter monitoring station and use our open-source software so you could monitor the air quality in your place of living.</p>

        <p>Let's live healthier life and start measuring the air quality and filtering it if necessary.</p>
