##  Charts framework

Downloaded from https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts
As there's only one 3rd-party framework i don't like to use CocoaPods at this time.
Added as universal binary to reduce amount of sources and compilation time
This was compiled by me from sources, from latest available commit (b1191bc146b98fddb0cab7324f94a993ffa3d74f)
